# FASTAPI-CHAT-PDF

This project involves building a chat-based interface to interact with PDF documents. It includes a **backend** powered by FastAPI and a **frontend** built with React.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Requirements

### Backend

- **Python 3.8+**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **FastAPI** for building the REST API
- **SQLAlchemy** for database interactions
- **Groq** API for generating responses

Dependencies for the backend are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:

```sh
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend

- **Node.js**
- **React.js** with **Tailwind CSS** for styling

Dependencies for the frontend are listed in `package.json`. Install them using:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```sh
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the FastAPI server:
   ```sh
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   The backend will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Application Overview

- **Navbar Component**: Allows users to upload PDFs, display uploaded file names, and navigate through the app.
- **ChatWindow Component**: Provides a chat interface to interact with the uploaded PDF content. Users can ask questions, and the response will be generated by the backend using the Groq API.

    "document_id": 1,
    "question": "What is this document about?"
  }
  ```

## Environment Variables

- The backend requires environment variables to store API keys and configurations.
- Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` directory:

```
UPLOAD_FOLDER=uploads
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/dbname
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
